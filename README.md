# PicoKenbak

# What is this?
PicoKenbak is a KENBAK-1 emulator designed to run on a
Raspberry Pi Pico. It was made as part of a school project.
It is written in C and licensed under the MIT license.
See LICENSE for details.

The code itself can use some major refactoring and some
improvements and bug fixing, as it was quickly hacked
together in a day. Those will come eventually.
Please, if you see any potential improvements, feel free
to open an issue to discuss them.
